body:
  - Whether through skilled graduates ready to lead the workforce, inventions developed from cutting-edge research discoveries or transformative international partnerships, U of G is improving life every day. Our three campuses span urban hubs and rural communities, and we are one of Canada’s leading comprehensive and learner-centred universities.
  - Our community makes strategic and significant contributions to local, provincial and national economies, and we welcome and pursue opportunities to support others.
  - We recently commissioned Ernst & Young to measure our economic impact across Canada and Ontario and in the regions our campuses call home. This Economic Impact Report explains how the University’s teaching, research and community-building endeavours contribute to stronger, more sustainable and more inclusive economies. I encourage you to read this report to learn how U of G is making a difference locally, nationally and globally.
