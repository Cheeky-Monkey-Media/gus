title: Indigenous Land Acknowledgment
body: |
  Our campuses reside on the treaty lands of the Mississaugas of the Credit and lands that the Anishinaabe, Hodinohso:ni, Lūnaapéewak and Wendat peoples have inhabited for centuries. We understand that these lands are connected by the Dish with One Spoon Wampum and continue to be home to diverse communities of First Nations, Inuit and Métis Peoples. Acknowledging the land reminds us of our commitment to reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and lands.
