Our planet faces a major problem. One of its biggest ever in fact, and we need to solve it now. We must find efficient, effective and sustainable ways to feed our growing population all while protecting the environment. At the University of Guelph we have a 150 year legacy in agrifood and we are committed to innovation and research for years to come. We have the capacity to bring together the people and resources needed to pioneer Canada's next agricultural revolution, and to grow this country's food economy. Now with a game changing investment from the Canada First Research Excellence Fund we are ready to lead in meeting this food security challenge. That's food FROM thought.
