00:00:00,605 --> 00:00:04,295
At the University of Guelph, sustainability is an expression of

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:08,591
our mission to Improve Life. For us, sustainability is about

3
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:13,513
stewarding our valued resources – our people, our campus and

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,308
our planet – in order to meet the needs of the present, without

5
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:21,016
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own

6
00:00:21,016 --> 00:00:26,526
needs. At U of G, sustainability truly is a part of our shared story.

7
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:30,613
On our physical campus, promoting sustainability means

8
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,867
everything from reducing greenhouse gas emissions to

9
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:38,538
building a circular food system. It is also about using the University

10
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:43,376
as a living laboratory to incubate the big, bold and bright ideas that

11
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,879
generate new knowledge to improve life locally, and around

12
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,963
the world.

13
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:51,843
Our faculty are at the forefront of finding innovative solutions to the

14
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:57,682
most pressing issues of our time. U of G has 250 faculty engaged

15
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:02,187
in sustainability-related research. Our students can also enroll in

16
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,523
over 500 sustainability-focused courses.

17
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:09,319
Through grassroots mobilization, community engagement,

18
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,947
research and experiential learning, our students are at the

19
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:17,368
forefront leading change both on and off campus. Their work has

20
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:21,603
inspired and motivated changes that advance sustainability at the

21
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:25,335
University, in local communities and internationally.

22
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:29,881
Because at the University of Guelph, sustainability is part of

23
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,843
who we are – for all who choose to study here, explore here,

24
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,472
teach here and work here, sustainability is part of

25
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,140
our shared story.
