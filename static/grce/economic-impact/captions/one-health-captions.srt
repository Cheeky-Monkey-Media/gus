1
00:00:00,515 --> 00:00:02,932
(soft music)

2
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:09,500
- So in January of 2020,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,850
I was teaching my fourth
year medical virology course.

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,940
And I was aware that there
was this new respiratory virus

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,840
that was infecting people in China

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,260
and spreading rather quickly.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,470
And so, as a class, we would
watch this red dot in China

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,530
get bigger and bigger

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,500
and then these new red
dots were showing up

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,540
in all these other countries

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,510
and we kept asking, when is
it gonna show up in Canada?

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,510
- I think my moment was when
the virus jumped from China

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,300
to Iran and Italy in
very short succession.

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,520
- I think the data became
scary at the beginning of March

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,550
where certainly more countries
started to become affected,

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,750
nothing was being done
particularly aggressively

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,730
at that time.

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,033
And then the shutdown happened
and it kind of became real.

19
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,240
- [Man] We've always said,
there's a pandemic virus

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,073
out there.

21
00:00:59,073 --> 00:00:59,906
It's going to happen again.

22
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:02,870
And we've seen examples and
I think we got overconfident.

23
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,520
We had SARS that was controlled.

24
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,480
We had another Coronavirus, MERS,

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,700
Middle Eastern Respiratory
Syndrome, that was controlled.

26
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,400
And I think we've assumed
that we can control things.

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,050
And we've realized that we can't.

28
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,860
- [Woman] The planning
that needed to be done

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,970
before the disease came to our borders,

30
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,423
did not seem to be done.

31
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,320
- I think people realize now
that any infectious disease

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,786
or emerging infectious disease can affect

33
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:29,076
any part of the world.

34
00:01:29,076 --> 00:01:32,030
And also it can emerge
from any type of species.

35
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,400
I mean, who would have thought that MERS

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,650
could be transmitted from
bats to camels to people.

37
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,330
So you can't rule out any animal species

38
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,530
and you can't rule out the
fact that it can affect

39
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,630
any part of the world.

40
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,530
- One Health, to me, is
a collaborative approach

41
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,270
among multiple disciplines,

42
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,460
as well as other societal actors,

43
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,930
so community members,

44
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,390
potentially politicians,
those in industries,

45
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,853
and essentially looking at
complex or wicked problems

46
00:02:04,853 --> 00:02:08,380
that occur at the
intersection of human, animal

47
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,930
and environmental health.

48
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,980
- Zoonotic infections are a prime example

49
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,390
of the One Health concept.

50
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,670
We are destroying habitat,

51
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,210
and that means that humans and animals

52
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,710
are coming into closer contact.

53
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,200
The more you destroy the habitat,

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,640
the more likely you are
to have this interaction.

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,210
And then, you know, again, it
could transmit human to human.

56
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,700
- This pandemic's also showing how we need

57
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,290
this broad intersect or
approach to infectious diseases.

58
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,750
It can't just be medicine
and veterinary medicine,

59
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,200
and it can't just be science.

60
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,220
It has to be a social
science, its behavior.

61
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,060
The bigger challenges
we're dealing with now

62
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,470
are things like vaccine hesitancy.

63
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,850
- I understand vaccine
hesitancy to stem from mistrust.

64
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,050
If we don't have buy-in from the public,

65
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,970
if they don't trust the product,

66
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,970
if they don't trust the policy
makers and the providers,

67
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,480
then the best vaccines may never
make it into people's arms.

68
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,900
We have a lot of access to media

69
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,230
and many of us have a lot of
time to spend on the internet.

70
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,170
And we got to see the mess of science,

71
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,880
what it looks like before
things are established,

72
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,080
before things are settled.

73
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,330
There will be people that say,

74
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,960
"You see the scientists don't know

75
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,350
what they're talking about".

76
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,210
When it might be the case
that they are changing

77
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,410
their directives in light of new evidence.

78
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,530
And that's a sign of good science.

79
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,410
- I found the University of Guelph

80
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,780
to be extraordinarily collaborative,

81
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,490
a really a great environment
to build relationships

82
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,300
and do work with other researchers

83
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,410
outside of your own discipline.

84
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,880
I think we also have a
really unique combination

85
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,160
of expertise here.

86
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,350
We have the veterinary
college and One Health

87
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,140
has really taken leadership
out of the veterinary field.

88
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,500
We have, you know, the
Agricultural College

89
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,110
strong biological sciences,

90
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,020
strong environmental focus,

91
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,870
and then really strong social science,

92
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,460
which is incredibly
important when we think about

93
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,390
the entire One Health approach.

94
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,580
- Our research actually
has expanded considerably

95
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,900
after we demonstrated
that our vaccine platform

96
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,460
works against SARS-CoV-2.

97
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,560
This is actually kind of
taking the One Health approach

98
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,930
and flipping on its side.

99
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,550
We're taking an animal pathogen

100
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,300
and turning it into a
benign vaccine vector,

101
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,660
which can protect humans.

102
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,800
But interestingly, we
can also use this vaccine

103
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,470
to vaccinate production animals.

104
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,810
- Optimizing this vaccine platform,

105
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,810
I first and foremost,
feel grateful and honored

106
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,280
to be a part of this team.

107
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,680
The University of Guelph
plays a significant role

108
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,320
in the prevention of the next pandemic.

109
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,950
Just incorporating or
being a part of One Health

110
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,950
is the first step towards that.

111
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,850
- My work just deals
with infectious diseases

112
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,930
and we're always on the
lookout for something new.

113
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,570
We really focus on that interface

114
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,970
between humans and animals.

115
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,950
So we track current diseases,

116
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,610
we track what we think
are emerging diseases

117
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,150
and we track things that are just unusual.

118
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,940
- I think my research can help us prepare

119
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,780
for the next pandemic in
really providing more evidence

120
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,670
and continuing the conversation

121
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:10,040
on how important the environment
and environmental health

122
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,030
and wildlife health are in preventing

123
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,130
any kind of disease
event that we might see.

124
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,600
- Health requires this
kind of broad perspective.

125
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,330
And there isn't one
discipline or one researcher

126
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,840
that can bring in all the
necessary perspectives

127
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,520
and all the necessary tools.

128
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,110
- I think if we reflect
on the entire situation

129
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,500
with the pandemic and
embrace a One Health approach

130
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,860
in our pandemic preparedness,

131
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,017
we can be prepared for the next one.

132
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:43,332
(soft music)
