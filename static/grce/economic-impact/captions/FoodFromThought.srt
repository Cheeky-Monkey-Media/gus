(gentle inspirational music)

00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,680
- [Narrator] Our planet
faces a major problem,

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,040
one of its biggest ever, in fact,

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,060
and we need to solve it now.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,680
We must find efficient, effective,

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,610
and sustainable ways to
feed our growing population,

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,083
all while protecting the environment.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,490
At the University of Guelph,

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,250
we have a 150-year legacy in agrifood,

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,610
and we are committed to
innovation and research

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,963
for years to come.

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,870
We have the capacity to bring together

13
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,330
the people and resources needed

14
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,240
to pioneer Canada's next
agricultural revolution,

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,780
and to go grow this
country's food economy.

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,040
Now, with a game-changing investment

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,720
from the Canada First
Research Excellence Fund,

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,180
we are ready to lead

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,563
in meeting this food security challenge.

20
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,750
That's food FROM thought.

21
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,653
From Canada's food university,
the University of Guelph.
