Schooling was never a goal,

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,990
like I never thought of schooling

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,930
as being a way to get
a better life for me,

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,551
I thought if I didn't
make it in basketball,

6
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,389
I wouldn't make it at all.

7
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,432

00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,700
(shoe squeaking)

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,730
- I started playing
basketball at eight years old.

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,040
I was really really bad
my first couple years

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,170
I never played basketball before

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,897
My dad never played basketball before

15
00:00:38,897 --> 00:00:41,609
and I remember watching Kobe Bryant

16
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:42,917
play basketball and I was like,

17
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,250
"Wow I didn't know you
could really do that stuff."

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,570
I'd never seen anyone
do anything like that.

19
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,750
So after that, I actually fell in love

20
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,190
with the game a lot more.

21
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,270
I spent hours and hours practicing

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,990
and ever since then, I've
been playing competitively.

23
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,707
- [Coach] I remember it was
in the other gym and you said,

24
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:57,553
"Coach O, If I steal, if I make
this one from center court,

25
00:00:57,553 --> 00:01:00,100
you gotta play me one
on one," and he made it.

26
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,590
So we had to play one on one.

27
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,958
- I remember I won though.

28
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:03,791
- [Coach O'Rourk] Yeah you won.

29
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:04,624
- [Coach O'Rourk] My assistant coach,

30
00:01:04,624 --> 00:01:07,620
he was at the nationals, and
Banky was on Team Alberta

31
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,960
and we were searching
for a particular need

32
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,920
which was rebounding and athletic forward.

33
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,280
Conrad had texted me right away

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,320
when he was out there after watching

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,220
Alberta and Banky play and Banky actually

36
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,773
lead the nationals in
rebounding that summer.

37
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,897
I mean we have a motto, we try and say,

38
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:26,920
"recruit character, teach skill."

39
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,440
and he's definitely a character kid

40
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,690
right from the beginning.

41
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,367
(door opening and shutting)

42
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,453
- [Bankole Alade] Early
on I didn't do well.

43
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,900
I was playing like zero minutes.

44
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,080
I was probably playing like
two minutes every second game.

45
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,080
At the same time, I was
doing terrible at school.

46
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,440
I remember at the end
of my first semester,

47
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,370
I actually almost got
kicked out of university

48
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,670
for having a super low average.

49
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,690
I'm just saying to myself, "This is old."

50
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,060
Why, why am I, why am
I doing all this for.

51
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,460
This doesn't make any sense.

52
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:04,350
(inspirational music)

53
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,183
- [Coach O'Rourk] Well he struggled,

54
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:08,650
he struggled academically and
he struggled with basketball.

55
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,370
- I even told one of
my friends before end,

56
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,660
I told him, "I'm about to talk to Chris,

57
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,910
I'm about to quit the basketball team

58
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,760
and I'm about to drop out of school."

59
00:02:15,957 --> 00:02:16,990
- [Coach O'Rourk] I remember
Conrad and I sitting down

60
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,680
with him and saying "You
know it's your first year

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,830
it's a transition."

62
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,920
- He said, "Banky, we see
you have a lot of potential

63
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,730
inside of you." And he
tried to make me question

64
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,480
if I really had done everything possible.

65
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,620
You're not training all the time.

66
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,090
You're not going to workouts all the time.

67
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,720
Like you're not doing
everything you need to,

68
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,060
to be successful and that's something

69
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,610
I never really thought about.

70
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,890
I feel like I, especially early on,

71
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,280
it was more me not being good enough.

72
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,027
And less of me not working hard enough.

73
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:46,610
(ball bouncing)

74
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,759
- [Coach O'Rourk] Let's
do a rescreen roll.

75
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,030
Come and we'll rescreen.

76
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,820
- [Bankole Alade] That summer,
I was training every day

77
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,130
I lifted every day. I
feel like I noticed myself

78
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,650
getting better from a
basketball standpoint.

79
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,060
But if it is possible for me
to get better at basketball

80
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,629
by working harder, why
isn't it possible for me

81
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:03,379
to improve the rest of my
life by working a bit harder.

82
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,790
- [Coach O'Rourk] So the
student athlete mentor program,

83
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,560
there's all kinds of resources there.

84
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,840
How to write papers,
study habits, there's just

85
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,740
a whole gambit of things they can access.

86
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,450
And Banky was in that,
I think he just felt

87
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,793
his confidence grow.

88
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,350
- Personally, I did not
like school whatsoever.

89
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,100
But taking marketing was
such a different rope

90
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,150
than any of the other classes I've taken.

91
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,410
They weren't grading me on
how much I could remember,

92
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,490
or how much I studied before hand.

93
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,200
They graded me on more of a how well

94
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,200
I'm able to convey thoughts of
what I'm thinking in my head.

95
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,160
Allow me to use a
different side of my brain

96
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,330
that I wasn't used to that I
actually enjoyed a lot more.

97
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,950
This one good I mean I'm
doing digital strategy.

98
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,250
So it's a little bit different
than... (faded talking)

99
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,320
- [Dr. Rodenburg] I think
that he found his passion.

100
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,270
I think he found his confidence.
I think he found his voice.

101
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,930
And I think he realized he
can contribute in some way.

102
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,030
- Head companies who have,
who may have ulterior motives

103
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,350
The University of Guelph
has a lot of resources

104
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,020
to help students do good in school.

105
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,815
I would tell every single student,

106
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:11,070
if you want to do well on essays,

107
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,210
go to the writing services
at the learning center

108
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,320
because they're there to help,

109
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,580
and you will do better guaranteed.

110
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,330
JC was the first club
that I joined at Guelph.

111
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,560
The first step of actually
joining a student club

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,100
was something I never
thought that I would do ever.

113
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,200
It helped me grow a lot as a person.

114
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
And being in a club, you
realize how important

115
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,610
these things really are
to maximizing your success

116
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,720
at the university, but one of
the things I began to realize

117
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,432
is that no black students
would ever attend these events.

118
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:41,599
(inspirational music)

119
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,120
- It's gonna be an exciting journey.

120
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,636
This is the first time
we're doing it obviously

121
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:53,210
(several students talking)

122
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,010
- [Mikyas Tessema] I wanted
to be a part of a organization

123
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,200
that endorsed the networking between

124
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,190
black students and young professionals.

125
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,200
And as soon as I saw Banky's post,

126
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,870
I thought this was the
best place for me to have

127
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,650
that team feeling at U of G.

128
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,270
- [Bankole Alade] There
was such a big divide

129
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,360
and black students were missing out.

130
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,810
And we felt that we could
easily take down these barriers

131
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,550
that they see and hopefully
get them to capitalize

132
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,540
on these amazing opportunities
that the university has.

133
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,090
- [Mikyas Tessema] The
Guelph Black Professionals

134
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:25,337
has shown me how to be a better leader,

135
00:05:25,337 --> 00:05:27,030
you're only as strong
as your weakest link,

136
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,060
so, as long as everyone is involved

137
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,890
and actively participating

138
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,590
the whole team will be successful.

139
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,150
- Having this organization not only helps

140
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,440
black students in our community,

141
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,410
it helps everybody else think differently

142
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,400
about the community.

143
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,940
Everything that you're
doing is influencing

144
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,550
and affecting people so
positively, it's so amazing.

145
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,837
I am so proud to know you.

146
00:05:51,837 --> 00:05:52,714
- [Bankole Alade] Thank you.

147
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:53,860
- Yeah I mean you are just incredible.

148
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,047
I think what happens is we
come with voices in our head

149
00:05:58,047 --> 00:06:00,460
that have been told to us our whole lives,

150
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,920
and I see for Banky someone
that might have been

151
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,350
telling himself wrong
things about who he was.

152
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,330
And I think as an institution
and as an instructor

153
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,630
our opportunities help
them find those voices,

154
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,690
the real voices, who they really are.

155
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,550
- [Bankole Alade] You can find
passion in any university.

156
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,440
I think if anyone looked
at me in first year,

157
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,155
I don't think anyone
really would have said,

"you could be going to do your Master's."

159
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,470
I couldn't do it. I didn't
think I could do it.

160
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,303
I don't have the grades to do this.

161
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:29,670
But now to be where I am now,

162
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,900
I have all these possibilities
and all these opportunities.

163
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,143
And it's just so amazing to think about.
